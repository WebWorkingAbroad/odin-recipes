   <h3> Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
   
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li> 
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li> 
    <li>2 cups cranberries</li>

    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <br>
  
   <li>Flour: This cranberry pie starts with a cup of all-purpose flour. </li>
   
    <li>Sugar: A cup of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li> 
    <li>Salt: You might not think a pinch of salt would make much of a difference, but you'll miss it if you don't use it.</li> 
    <li>Cranberries: Buy whole berries that are plump, firm, and unblemished. You can substitute frozen cranberries for fresh, but it will change the consistency of the batter.</li>
    <li>Nuts: This recipe calls for walnuts, but you can pecans if you'd rather.</li>
   <li>Eggs: Whole eggs add moisture and bind the batter together.</li>
   <li>Almond extract: Almond extract lends a subtly complex and nutty flavor. You can substitute vanilla extract if you'd like.</li>
  
    
   </ul>
